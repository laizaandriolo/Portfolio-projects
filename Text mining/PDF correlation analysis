# The findAssocs function in the tm package in R is used to find associations between terms
# (words) in a term-document matrix based on their co-occurrence. It helps identify words 
# that are correlated with a target word within a given document or corpus. 
# Here's an explanation of its main parameters: findAssocs(tdm, terms, corlimit)
# corlimit: A numeric value between -1 and 1 that represents the minimum correlation 
# required for a term to be considered associated with the target terms. If the correlation
# between a term and the target term exceeds this limit, it is considered associated.

associated_words <- findAssocs(opinions.tdm, terms = "vitamina", corlimit = 0.2)

# Extract the Associated Words

# Subset TDM for the Target Word and Associated Words
selected_terms <- c("vitamina", associated_words)
filtered_tdm <- as.matrix(opinions.tdm[selected_terms,])
